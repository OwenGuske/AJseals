Clean Code Practices:
I organized the HTML structure using semantic tags like <header>, <div>, and <ul> to enhance readability and maintainability. I also commented on important sections of the code to make it easier for others to follow.

I invite visitors to reach out with opportunities in product management, highlighting my dedication to both technology and athletics.
